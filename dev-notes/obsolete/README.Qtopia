Quassel IRC for Qtopia - Release Notes
======================================

NOTE: QuasselTopia is currently mostly broken even if it happens to build!

We provide a Quassel IRC client that can be run on mobile devices running
Trolltech's Qtopia. The name of this client version has not yet been
determined; we like QuasselTopia, Quassel IRC Mobile Edition or maybe
something else. We'll call it QuasselTopia here.

QuasselTopia has only been tested with the Trolltech Greenphone. We sort of
rely on its features being available, and we assume a screensize of 240x320.
Of course, QuasselTopia might well run on other Qtopia-enabled devices as
well; it's just not tested yet. We will eventually support general Qtopia
devices as well.

Note that QuasselTopia is just the client; it can't do IRC by
itself. You'll need a Quassel core running on some server or PC for
the phone to connect to.

In its current state, QuasselTopia cannot do much except for
connecting to a core and displaying the buffers you are in. Oh, and
chatting of course.  But you cannot change any settings, create/edit
identities or networks, you can't even connect to a network from the
Greenphone. So in order to test QuasselTopia, it's a good idea to have
a desktop Quassel client connected at the same time, so that you can
do these things from your PC.

QuasselTopia thus is in a very early state, merely a proof of concept
rather than something for day-to-day use. It shows already though that
a mobile Quassel version is feasible and usable, and QuasselTopia will
evolve together with the desktop version.

We still hope you have fun!

Please refer to INSTALL.Qtopia for installation information.

Thanks,
